******  USAGE: 2 possibilities
1) python3 main.py --image path/to/image.jpg
2) python3 main.py --video path/to/video.jpg


******  INSTRUCTION (with RECOGNIZE_PAINTING and RECTIFY_PAITING equals to True):
Ones the program starts, it does some checks and if everything is alright a window with the input video (or image) shows up. Hopefully, the paintings will be surrounded by a green rectangle and the number of pictures that are recognized (in real time) will appear at the bottom right.
By clicking on a specific rectangle two operations are performed:
1) The program tries to recognize the paiting, giving the following information: Name, Author, Cronology, Materials, Dimensions and url to the official web site of Galleria Estense.
2) The picture is rectified.


******  FURTHER DETAILS
Every time you start the program, it automatically checks the program settings, if all paths are correct and if the input exists.

The main.py is the main program. There are 3 global settings that must be taken into account. These settings must be changed manually. Default values are:
1) RESIZE_VIDEO = 0.5
2) RECOGNIZE_PAINTING   = True
3) RECTIFY_PAITING      = True

The first one concerns the size of the input to be processed. If 0.5 is set, it means that the video is processed at half the resolution. This increases accuracy as well as performance.

The second one deals with the SIFT algorithm. If active, every time you double click a specific painting, the program tries to find a match with all the painting in the Galleria Estense (the dataset is in the Webscraping folder).

The last one is about the rectification. There are 2 functions in the source code:
1) getPerspectiveTransform_auto
2) getPerspectiveTransform_manual
The first one (default) automatically tries to rectify the painting. Sometimes it fails when the picture is not exactly rectangular. 
To overcome this issue, the second function might come in handy (select it inside the mouse_callback function). In this case, a window named "get_4_points" will show up with the selected paiting. To rectify it, manually select the four corners by clicking four time onto it. It is absolutely crucial that we have a consistent ordering of the points in the rectangle. Please specify the points in top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left order.
