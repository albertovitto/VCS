first to convert the matrix type of value to float32, 
do de product and reconvert all (through rounding and clipping) to unit8?
np.clip()

all bins of all color planes need to sum up to 1

I usually use something like: im = np.random.randint(0, 255, [3, 128, 128], dtype=np.uint8)
L1 normalization consists of just dividing by the array sum
